# CAD files repository from Lamun projects' (Laboratory of Microbiology, University of Neuch√¢tel, Switzerland)

Here you'll find 3D models of scientific devices developed by the laboratory and related to some of our publications and [collaborations](https://github.com/Bacterial-Fungal-Interactions-SFA). The rationale for creating this repository was that we had various issues while using third-party models, particularly with complex ones. As this domain is steadily developing in the laboratory, it will host more and more material with time. Check it out regularly!
